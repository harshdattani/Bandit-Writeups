### Summary

Write ups of how I solved  **[Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)** security wargame levels, might be useful to those who are got stuck in any level.There are total 26 levels. Will add solutions from time to time

** As written in [overthewire.org](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/): **

>The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames.

This game, like most other games, is organised in levels. You start at Level 0 and try to “beat” or “finish” it. Finishing a level results in information on how to start the next level. The pages on this website for “Level <X>” contain information on how to start level X from the previous level. E.g. The page for Level 1 has information on how to gain access from Level 0 to Level 1. All levels in this game have a page on this website, and they are all linked to from the side menu on the left of this page.
